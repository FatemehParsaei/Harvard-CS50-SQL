DESE wants to assess which schools achieved a 100% graduation rate. 
In 6.sql, write a SQL query to find the names of schools (public or charter!) 
that reported a 100% graduation rate.




select name from schools where "id" IN (select school_id from graduation_rates 
where "graduated" = 100);
